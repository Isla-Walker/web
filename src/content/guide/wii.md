<l class="notice info">To install WiiLink, you will need to have a homebrewed console. If your console isn't already homebrewed, follow the instructions [here](https://wii.hacks.guide/get-started) to homebrew your Wii.</l>

## Section I - Patching WADs

</br>

> [If you want to see detailed instructions on how to install the WADs, click here!](#section-ii---installing-wads)

</br>

1. Visit the [WiiLink Patcher releases page](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/releases) and download the correct patcher for your operating system.
2. On `Windows`, run `WiiLinkPatcher_Windows_vXXX.exe`\*. <br>

   On `MacOS`, open a terminal window on the folder where the patcher downloaded, then run `chmod +x WiiLinkPatcher_macOS-<arch>_vXXX`\*. Afterwards, run `./WiiLinkPatcher_macOS-<arch>_vXXX`\* and the patcher will launch right on your terminal.<br>

   On `Linux`, open a terminal window on the folder where the patcher downloaded, then run `chmod +x WiiLinkPatcher_Linux-<arch>_vXXX`\*. Afterwards, run `./WiiLinkPatcher_Linux-<arch>_vXXX`\* and the patcher will launch right on your terminal.

   On `Android`, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/Isla-Walker/WiiLinkPatcherAndroid#getting-started) to launch the unofficial patcher script in Termux.

   <l class="notice info">Alternatively, you can rename the patcher file on MacOS or Linux to a simpler filename like `WiiLinkPatcher` and run the commands with that name in mind.</l>

> \***For Linux and MacOS Users:** Replace `<arch>` with either `x64` or `ARM64` depending on your system architecture, and `XXX` with the latest version on the filename.

1. Choose your installation setup:

</br>

### Express Installation
   - Press `1` for `Express Install Setup`. Follow the steps below:
     1. Select your region for the WiiConnect24 channels.
     2. Select whether or not you would like to install the regional channels.
     3. Select what language you would like for the regional channels as well as your preferred Food Channel version if you chose to install them.
     4. Select `Wii`.

### Custom Installation
   - Press `2` for `Custom Install Setup`. Follow the steps below:
     1. Select which channels you would like to install out of the list.
     2. Select `Wii`.
     3. Please wait a moment for the patcher to download and patch the files on your device.
     4. Once it's done, you can safely close the patcher. All of the files are ready on your SD Card.
     5. If it did not copy everything automatically to your SD Card or USB Device, copy the `WAD` and `apps` folder in the directory where the patcher executable is located to the root of your SD Card or USB Device.

## Section II - Installing WADs and Patching `Wii Mail`

<l class="notice info">If you already have `Wii Mail` patched for use with RiiConnect24, you don't need to run the WiiLink Mail Patcher.</l>

1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
2. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
3. Launch yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).
4. Press `A` to select your source device, which defaults to `Wii SD Card`.
5. If your Wii is not Japanese region, and you have chosen to install regional channels, install `WiiLink Address Settings.wad` before anything else. This is required for use of the Food Channel and the Photo Prints Channel.
6. Highlight all other WADs and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
7. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
8. Open the `WiiLink Mail Patcher` application inside the Homebrew Channel.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions.
10. Once the patcher is finished, you can return to the Wii Menu.

## Section III (Optional) - Connecting to DNS, using the Address Settings and using AnyGlobe Changer

</br>

### Connecting to DNS

<l class="notice info smallwidth">This step is optional, but it's recommended as it allows additional services to function.</l>

1. Go to the Wii Settings --> Internet --> Connection Settings --> the Connection that you're using --> Change Settings.

2. Make your way to the "Auto-Obtain DNS" setting.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">Take note that the "Auto-Obtain IP Address" and "Auto-Obtain DNS" settings both look similar, so be sure that you're on the DNS setting.</l>

3. Once you made sure that you're on the DNS setting, Click on "No", then "Advanced Settings".

Set your Primary DNS to --> 167.235.229.36<br>
Set your Secondary DNS to --> 1.1.1.1

4. After you're done setting up the DNS, save the changes and let the system perform the Connection Test.

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">If the Connection Test failed, use a different Internet Connection or try again.</l>

6. Go to the 1st page of the "Internet" category, then select "User Agreements", then select "Yes".

7. Allow the EULA to load. If it tells you that WiiConnect24 isn't being offered in your region, change your country to a supported one and try again (we recommend the United Kingdom for PAL, and the United States for NTSC-U). The developers recommended that you read the EULA, as it gives information about the service. If you do not see the WiiLink logo on the EULA, the DNS will not work on your network. If you want to enable it, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/WiiLink24/DNS-Server">DNS Server application</a>.

8. Once you read the EULA, click on "I ACCEPT".

9. Navigate back to the main settings page, select WiiConnect24, and set "WiiConnect24" and "Standby Connection" to On.

### Setting your region in AnyGlobe Changer

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">This allows you to set your country if the WiiConnect24 settings say that it's not supported.</l>
1. Launch The Homebrew Channel on your console.
2. Open AnyGlobe Changer.
3. Read the disclaimer, and press `1` to continue.
4. Using the D-pad, set your region and sub-region.
5. Highlight `Save Settings`, then press `A` to save.
6. Return to the System Menu.

### Adding Personal Information

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">WiiLink never stores your personal data. For more information on what is used, read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).</l>

<l class="notice info smallwidth">Adding your personal information to the Address Settings will allow the Photo Prints Channel to send images to your email, and the Food Channel to deliver the food to your house.</l>

<l class="notice warn smallwidth">You are responsible for entering your correct Address Information. Failure to do so may result in emails and/or orders not succeeding.</l>

#### Photo Prints Channel

1. Launch the Photo Prints Channel from your Wii's home menu.
2. On the bottom right, press `Address Settings` and then `Yes`.
3. Click on `Email Address` within the settings and type in your email address. (make sure you **put it in correctly** or it **will not work!**)
4. Press `OK` and then `Done`.
5. Once you are in the SPD main menu, choose `Digicam` in the `Choose Channel` menu.

#### Food Channel

<l class="notice warn smallwidth">If you want to use the **Domino's** version of the Food Channel, please follow this [guide](/guide/demae) instead. Otherwise, proceed with the guide below.</l>

1. Launch the Food Channel from your Wii's home menu.
2. In the Delivery Address, Press the `Change Address Information` button in the main menu.
3. Replace the Placeholder info with the Following:

- `Your First and Last Name`
- `Your Phone Number (country code FIRST, phone number afterwards)`
- `Your City`
- `Your Home Address`
- `Your Zip Code`

(Make sure you **put it in correctly** or it **will not work!** Use the example data in the settings as a template to put your information in correctly.)

4. Press `OK` and then `Done`
5. Once you are in the SPD main menu, choose `Demae` in the `Choose Channel` menu.
6. When you return to the Food Channel via `SPD`, it will display your information that you put in and will give a confirmation box. Once you double check and everything is correct, click on Yes.
