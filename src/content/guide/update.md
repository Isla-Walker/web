## Section I - Patching WADs

</br>

> [If you want to see detailed instructions on how to install the WADs, click here!](#section-ii---installing-wads)

</br>

1. Visit the [WiiLink Patcher releases page](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/releases) and download the correct patcher for your operating system.
2. On `Windows`, run `WiiLinkPatcher_Windows_vXXX.exe`\*. <br>

   On `MacOS`, open a terminal window on the folder where the patcher downloaded, then run `chmod +x WiiLinkPatcher_macOS-<arch>_vXXX`\*. Afterwards, run `./WiiLinkPatcher_macOS-<arch>_vXXX`\* and the patcher will launch right on your terminal.<br>

   On `Linux`, open a terminal window on the folder where the patcher downloaded, then run `chmod +x WiiLinkPatcher_Linux-<arch>_vXXX`\*. Afterwards, run `./WiiLinkPatcher_Linux-<arch>_vXXX`\* and the patcher will launch right on your terminal.

   On `Android`, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/Isla-Walker/WiiLinkPatcherAndroid#getting-started) to launch the unofficial patcher script in Termux.

   <l class="notice info">Alternatively, you can rename the patcher file on MacOS or Linux to a simpler filename like `WiiLinkPatcher` and run the commands with that name in mind.</l>

> \***For Linux and MacOS Users:** Replace `<arch>` with either `x64` or `ARM64` depending on your system architecture, and `XXX` with the latest version on the filename.

Press `2` for `Custom Install`. Follow the steps below:

1. Select which channels you would like to update from the list.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">For those migrating from RiiConnect24, you only need new `News Channel` and `Forecast Channel` WADs. Feel free to download any additional regional WiiLink WADs you want too.</l>

2. Select your platform.
3. Please wait a moment for the patcher to download and patch the files on your device.
4. Once it's done, press `3` to exit the patcher.
5. If it did not copy everything automatically to your SD Card or USB Device, copy the `WAD` and `apps` folder in the directory where the patcher executable is located to the root of your SD Card or USB Device.

## Section II - Installing WADs

<l class="notice info smallwidth">If you’re using Dolphin, install WADs through the menu (`Tools` > `Install WAD…`) instead of following these instructions.</l>

1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
2. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
3. Launch yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).
4. Press `A` to select your source device, which defaults to `Wii SD Card`.
5. If your Wii is not Japanese region, and you have chosen to install regional channels, install `WiiLink Address Settings.wad` before anything else. This is required for use of the Food Channel and the Photo Prints Channel.
6. Highlight all other WADs and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
7. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.

<l class="notice warn smallwidth">If you receive error `-1022` or `-1029` while installing WADs, press `-` to uninstall the existing WAD, and try again.</l>

## Section III (Optional) - Connecting to DNS

</br>

### Connecting to DNS

<l class="notice info smallwidth">This step is optional, but it's recommended as it allows additional services to function. Please also note that this is only for real consoles, DNS is not supported in Dolphin and will not function.</l>

1. Go to the Wii Settings --> Internet --> Connection Settings --> the Connection that you're using --> Change Settings.

2. Make your way to the "Auto-Obtain DNS" setting.

<l class="notice info smallwidth">Take note that the "Auto-Obtain IP Address" and "Auto-Obtain DNS" settings both look similar, so be sure that you're on the DNS setting.</l>

3. Once you made sure that you're on the DNS setting, Click on "No", then "Advanced Settings".

Set your Primary DNS to --> 167.235.229.36<br>
Set your Secondary DNS to --> 1.1.1.1

4. After you're done setting up the DNS, save the changes and let the system perform the Connection Test.

<l class="notice generic smallwidth">If the Connection Test failed, use a different Internet Connection or try again.</l>

6. Go to the 1st page of the "Internet" category, then select "User Agreements", then select "Yes".

7. Allow the EULA to load. If it tells you that WiiConnect24 isn't being offered in your region, change your country to a supported one and try again (we recommend the United Kingdom for PAL, and the United States for NTSC-U). The developers recommended that you read the EULA, as it gives information about the service. If you do not see the WiiLink logo on the EULA, the DNS will not work on your network. If you want to enable it, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/WiiLink24/DNS-Server">DNS Server application</a>.

8. Once you read the EULA, click on "I ACCEPT".

9. Navigate back to the main settings page, select WiiConnect24, and set "WiiConnect24" and "Standby Connection" to On.
